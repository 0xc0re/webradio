WebRadio

WebRadio is an open-source Software Defined Radio (SDR) platform designed from
scratch to be remotely controlled from a browser. The front-end is written
in HTML5 and Javascript, and can be accessed from any modern browser, 
including from smartphones.

Internally the server is highly modular, with support for multiple tuners and
multiple demodulators per-tuner. As well as providing streaming audio to
clients, each receiver can be configured with additional sinks such as
server-side recording and data decoding.

Currently supported tuner hardware:

RTL2832U-based USB sticks

Support is planned for the following:

Ettus Research USRP
Fun Cube Dongle
External receivers with computer control support via Hamlib
